# Orientation control strategies in rotational hand movements
This repository contains two main folders: (1) experiment 1 (2) experiment 2

Each folder containt the main matlab file (exp1_main.m and exp2_main.m), in which the data is read and processed. 
The main file calls all auxiliary functions that generate statistical results as well as figures.
*In experiment 2 - the spherical statistical analysis is performed in R ('exp2_spherical_statistics').
The raw data is given in the 'data files exp 1' and 'data files exp 2' directories. Other text files required to run the code are given in 'text files exp 1' and text files exp 2' directories.
